<hr />

<p>When you want to gain a historical perspective on personal computing and programming languages, why not turn to one of the industry’s preeminent pioneers? That would be Alan Kay, winner of last year’s Turing Award for leading the team that invented Smalltalk, as well as for his fundamental contributions to personal computing.</p>

<p>如你想获得有关个人计算和编程语言的历史性观点，为什么不问问业界的某位先驱呢？这可能就是[Alan Kay], 他因为领导团队发明Smalltalk, 以及他对个人计算的根本性贡献，荣获去年的图灵奖。</p>

<p>Kay was one of the founders of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), where he led one of several groups that together developed modern workstations (and the forerunners of the Macintosh), Smalltalk, the overlapping window interface, desktop publishing, the Ethernet, laser printing, and network client-servers.</p>

<p>Kay是施乐帕洛阿尔托研究中心(Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, PARC)的创始人之一，他在那里领导了几个小组中的一个，这些组共同开发了现代工作站(Machintosh的前身)，Smalltalk，重叠式窗口界面，桌面出版，以太网，激光打印，以及网络的客户-服务器。</p>

<p>Prior to his work at PARC, Kay earned a Ph.D. in 1969 from the University of Utah, where he designed a graphical object-oriented personal computer and was a member of the research team that developed pioneering 3-D graphics work for the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Kay was also a “slight participant” in the original design of the ARPANet, which later became the Internet. He holds undergraduate degrees in mathematics and molecular biology from the University of Colorado. After leaving Xerox PARC, Kay went on to become chief scientist of Atari, a Fellow of Apple Computer, and vice president of research and development at The Walt Disney Company.</p>

<p>在他工作于PARC之前，Kay于1969年从犹他州立大学获得博士学位。在那里，他设计了一个图形化的面向对象的个人电脑，同时他也是一个研究小组的成员。这个组为高级研究项目管理局(ARPA)开发开创性的3-D图形装置。Kay也是ARPANet原始设计的“少量参与者“”，其后来演变成了互联网。他在科罗拉多州立大学获得数学和分子生物学的研究生学位。离开施乐PARC之后，Kay继续成为Atari的首席科学家，这是苹果电脑的同类，他也是沃特迪斯尼公司的研发副总裁。</p>

<p>Today he is Senior Fellow at Hewlett-Packard Labs and president of Viewpoints Research Institute, a nonprofit organization whose goal is to change how children are educated by creating a sample curriculum with supporting media for teaching math and science. This curriculum will use Squeak as its media, and will be highly interactive and constructive. Kay’s deep interests in children and education have been the catalysts for many of his ideas over the years.</p>

<p>今天，他是惠普公司的高等院士以及Viewpoint研究所的总裁，这是一个非盈利组织，其目标是通过创造带有支持媒体的样本课程来教授数学和科学，从而改变儿童接受教育的方式。这个课程将使用Squeak语言作为媒介，将具有高度交互性和建设性。Kay对儿童和教育的深度兴趣，是他多年来很多创意的催化剂。</p>

<p>In addition to winning the Turing Award, Kay recently received the Draper Prize from the National Academy of Engineering and the Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology, awarded every four years by the Inamori Foundation.</p>

<p>除了图灵奖，Kay最近从美国国家工程院获得了Draper奖，以及高等技术的Kyoto奖(京都赏)，此奖由Inamori基金会每4年颁发一次。</p>

<p>Guiding our tour through personal computing history with Kay is Stuart Feldman of IBM Research, where he is vice president and on-demand business transformation area strategist. Since joining IBM in 1995, Feldman has also served as vice president for Internet technology and was head of computer science in the research division.</p>

<p>带领我们和Kay一起游览个人计算历史的是IBM研究院的Stuart Feldman，他是研究院的副总裁以及随需应变(on-demand)业务转化领域的战略家。Feldman也曾经作为Internet技术的副总裁，是研究事业部中计算机科学的领导人。</p>

<p>Feldman also spent 11 years at Bellcore, where he held several research management positions in software engineering and computing systems, and 10 years at Bell Labs, where he was a computer science researcher. Feldman was a member of the original Unix team and is best known as the creator of the Make configuration management system and as the author of the first Fortran-77 compiler. He has a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is a member of the Queue Advisory Board.</p>

<p>Feldman也在Bellcore(Bell Communications Research)待了11年，在那里他做过多个软件工程和计算系统的研究管理职位，并在Bell实验室待了10年，那里他作为计算机科学研究员。Feldman是原始Unix团队的成员，以Make配置管理系统的创建者和第一个Fortran-77编译器的作者而著称。他从麻省理工学院取得应用数学的博士学位。他是Queue顾问委员会的成员。</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>STUART FELDMAN</strong> One of the topics that some of the younger people on our Queue editorial board keep asking about is the history of programming languages. The Queue board has a bimodal generation distribution, and those members who are in their 20s or 30s seem genuinely confused about where programming languages might actually come from. It’s my observation that we have one big language and one smaller language every decade—that appears to be all the field can afford. Smalltalk is one of those five- or 10-year events.</p>

<p><strong>STUART FELDMAN</strong> 一些更年轻的人在我们Queue编委会上不断问到的一个主题是编程语言的历史。Queue委员会的年龄分布是双峰模式，那些20或30岁的成员普遍对编程语言到底从何而来感到困惑。我的观察是，每十年就有一个主流语言(one big language)和一个较小众的语言，这看起来所有的领域（对编程语言的需要）都能对付。Smalltalk是那些5年或10年的事件之一。</p>

<p><strong>ALAN KAY</strong> In the late 1960s, Jean Sammet was able to track down and chronicle about 3,000 programming languages that were extant then. When things were simpler in a sense—but theoretically harder because the machines were slower, smaller, didn’t have hard drives most of the time, and had bad tools—people nonetheless rolled their own operating systems and programming languages whenever they felt like it. So there are zillions of them around.</p>

<p><strong>ALAN KAY</strong> 在1960年代晚期，Jean Sammet能追溯和记录当时存在大约3000种编程语言。当事情在某种意义上变简单了，但在理论上却更困难了。因为机器更慢更小，多数时没有硬盘驱动器，工具很糟糕。尽管如此，人们运行着他们自己的操作系统和编程语言，只要他们喜欢。因此，到处都有繁多的编程语言和操作系统。</p>

<p>For a <em>Scientific American</em> article 20 years ago, I came up with a facetious sunspot theory, just noting that there’s a major language or two every 101⁄2 years, and in between those periods are what you might call hybrid languages. These could be looked at as either an improvement on the old thing or almost a new thing. I chronicled Fortran as an improvement on an old thing or almost a new thing, and Algol and Lisp were the new thing.</p>

<p>对《科学美国人》20年前的一篇文章，我想出一个俏皮的支持理论，每隔10年半，将有一到两个主要的语言，而在这个期间的语言，你可称为混合语言。这些可看做对旧事物的改进，或者几乎是全新的事物。我将Fortran编目为旧事物的改进或者几乎一个新事物，而Algol和Lisp是新事物。</p>

<p>Then there was Simula, which the designers thought of as an extension of Algol. It was basically a preprocessor to Algol the way C++ was a preprocessor for C. It was a great concept and I was lucky enough to see it as almost a new thing. Smalltalk and Prolog happened in the early 1970s. The predecessor of Prolog was a wonderful thing that Carl Hewitt did in the late 1960s called Planner.</p>

<p>然后是Simula, 设计者们把它看做Algol的扩展。它根本上是Algol的一个预处理器，如同C++对于C是预处理器的方式。这是个伟大的概念，我足够幸运将它看做几乎全新的事物。Smalltalk和Prolog出现在1970年代早期。Prolog的预处理器非常棒，由Carl Hewitt在1960年代晚期完成，叫做Planner。</p>

<p>Perhaps it was commercialization in the 1980s that killed off the next expected new thing. Our plan and our hope was that the next generation of kids would come along and do something better than Smalltalk around 1984 or so. We all thought that the next level of programming language would be much more strategic and even policy-oriented and would have much more knowledge about what it was trying to do. But a variety of different things conspired together, and that next generation actually didn’t show up. One could actually argue—as I sometimes do—that the success of commercial personal computing and operating systems has actually led to a considerable retrogression in many, many respects.</p>

<p>大概是1980年代的商业化扼杀了期待的下一个新事物。我们的计划和希望是下一代的年轻人能一起来干，做一些比1984年前后Smalltalk更好的东西，等等。我们都认为，编程语言的下一层次本应更具战略性，甚至是面向策略的，本应包含更多所尝试去做之事的知识。但是，很多不同的事情凑在一起，让下一代编程语言事实上没有显现出来。事实上有人会认为 - 亦如我偶尔做的 - 商业化个人计算和操作系统的成功实际上导致了在很多很多方面的显著退步。</p>

<p>You could think of it as putting a low-pass filter on some of the good ideas from the ’60s and ’70s, as computing spread out much, much faster than educating unsophisticated people can happen. In the last 25 years or so, we actually got something like a pop culture, similar to what happened when television came on the scene and some of its inventors thought it would be a way of getting Shakespeare to the masses. But they forgot that you have to be more sophisticated and have more perspective to understand Shakespeare. What television was able to do was to capture people as they were.</p>

<p>你可以把它想成，随着计算向外传播远快于教育未开化之人的速度，而对一些来自60或70年代的良好想法放置了低通过滤器。在过去大约25年，我们事实上得到一些好像流行文化的东西，类似于当电视机出现时所发生的。一些发明者的初衷是，电视机是让莎士比亚戏剧走向大众的一个途径，但他们忽略了，为了理解莎士比亚，你必须更加精于世情并有多个视角。电视能够做的是捕捉人们本然的样子。</p>

<p>So I think the lack of a real computer science today, and the lack of real software engineering today, is partly due to this pop culture.</p>

<p>因此我想今天缺少真正的计算机科学，缺少真正的软件工程，部分归因于这一流行文化。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> So Smalltalk is to Shakespeare as Excel is to car crashes in the TV culture?</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 那么，Smalltalk对于莎士比亚，是否就如同Excel对于电视文化中的车祸？</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> No, if you look at it really historically, Smalltalk counts as a minor Greek play that was miles ahead of what most other cultures were doing, but nowhere near what Shakespeare was able to do.</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 不，如果你真从历史角度去看它，Smalltalk可当做小型的希腊戏剧，比大部分其它文明要领先几英里，但还没有接近莎士比亚所能做的。</p>

<p>If you look at software today, through the lens of the history of engineering, it’s certainly engineering of a sort—but it’s the kind of engineering that people without the concept of the arch did. Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.</p>

<p>如果你从工程的历史透镜去看今天的软件，它的确是某类工程 - 但它是那些对拱形结构都没有概念的人所做的工程。绝大多数今天的软件，非常象用数百万砖块堆积的埃及金字塔，没有结构的一致性，但仅靠蛮力和成千上万的奴隶。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> The analogy is even better because there are the hidden chambers that nobody can understand.</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 这个类比甚至更绝妙，因为这样里面有，无人能知的暗室。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> I would compare the Smalltalk stuff that we did in the ’70s with something like a Gothic cathedral. We had two ideas, really. One of them we got from Lisp: late binding. The other one was the idea of objects. Those gave us something a little bit like the arch, so we were able to make complex, seemingly large structures out of very little material, but I wouldn’t put us much past the engineering of 1,000 years ago.</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 我将我们在70年代做的Smalltalk玩意儿，比作哥德式教堂。事实上，我们有两个想法。其一来自Lisp: 延迟绑定。另一个是对象的想法。这些给了我们一些有点象拱形结构的东西，因此我们能够从小的材料中，做出复杂的、看起来大型的结构，但是我不会将我们放到1000年前的工程。</p>

<p>If you look at [Doug] Engelbart’s demo [a live online hypermedia demonstration of the pioneering work that Engelbart’s group had been doing at Stanford Research Institute, presented at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference], then you see many more ideas about how to boost the collective IQ of groups and help them to work together than you see in the commercial systems today. I think there’s this very long lag between what you might call the best practice in computing research over the years and what is able to leak out and be adapted in the much more expedient and deadline-conscious outside world.</p>

<p>如果你看看Englebart的演示，那么你会看见比今天商业系统中更多的创意，关于如何提升团体的共同智商并帮助他们一起工作。我想，在计算研究多年来你可能称之的最佳实践，与能够渗入并被更为应急和注重最终期限的外部世界所采纳的之间，有相当大的延滞。</p>

<p>It’s not that people are completely stupid, but if there’s a big idea and you have deadlines and you have expedience and you have competitors, very likely what you’ll do is take a low-pass filter on that idea and implement one part of it and miss what has to be done next. This happens over and over again. If you’re using early-binding languages as most people do, rather than late-binding languages, then you really start getting locked in to stuff that you’ve already done. You can’t reformulate things that easily.</p>

<p>这并不是说人们都彻头彻尾地愚蠢，但是如果有个大点子而你有最终期限，你有应急手段，还有竞争者，那么很有可能你将做的，就是对那个点子放置低通过滤器，然后实施其中一部分，漏掉下次必须做的。这一而再地发生。如果你使用绝大多数人使用的早期绑定语言(early-binding languages)，而非延迟绑定语言，那么事实上你刚开始就被你已经做的锁定住了。你难以重新规划它。</p>

<p>Let’s say the adoption of programming languages has very often been somewhat accidental, and the emphasis has very often been on how easy it is to implement the programming language rather than on its actual merits and features. For instance, Basic would never have surfaced because there was always a language better than Basic for that purpose. That language was Joss, which predated Basic and was beautiful. But Basic happened to be on a GE timesharing system that was done by Dartmouth, and when GE decided to franchise that, it started spreading Basic around just because it was there, not because it had any intrinsic merits whatsoever.</p>

<p>让我们来说说，编程语言的采纳经常有些偶然性，过去经常是强调实现一个编程语言多么容易，而非它实际的优点和特性。例如，Basic本不该浮出水面，因为对于那个目的已经有一个语言优于它。这个语言是Joss，早于Basic，非常漂亮。但是Basic碰巧在由Dartmouth完成的GE分时系统上，当GE决定经销这系统时，Basic就开始四处被传播，仅仅因为它就在那里，而非有任何内在优点。</p>

<p>This happens over and over again. The languages of Niklaus Wirth have spread wildly and widely because he has been one of the most conscientious documenters of languages and one of the earlier ones to do algorithmic languages using p-codes (pseudocodes)—the same kinds of things that we use. The idea of using those things has a common origin in the hardware of a machine called the Burroughs B5000 from the early 1960s, which the establishment hated.</p>

<p>这又一而再地发生。<a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/尼克劳斯·维尔特">Niklaus Wirth</a>的语言野蛮而广泛地传播<em>(注：他发明了Algol W、Pascal、Modula等语言)</em>，是因为他是最勤勤恳恳的语言文档撰写者之一，最早使用p代码(伪代码)作为算法语言的人之一 – 和我们使用的是同一类。使用那些东西的想法有个共同的根源，是在来自1960年代早期称为Burroughs B5000的硬件机器，这是保守派所憎恶的。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> Partly because there wasn’t any public information on most of it.</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 部分原因是对绝大多数这样的事情，没有任何公开的信息。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> Let me beg to differ. I was there, and Burroughs actually hired college graduates to explain that machine to data-processing managers. There was an immense amount of information available. The problem was that the DP managers didn’t want to learn new ways of computing, or even how to compute. IBM realized that and Burroughs didn’t.</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 让我说点不同的。我在那里，Burroughs的确雇佣了大学毕业生去向数据处理经理解释那个机器。有大量的信息可用。问题是那个经理不想学习计算的新方式，或甚至如何计算。IBM认识到那点了，但Burroughs没有。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> If memory serves, I was fascinated by that machine at the time, but I was unable to get the detail that made me understand it.</p>

<p>如果资金许可，那时我会被这机器迷住的，但是我无法获得让我理解它的细节。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> In fact, the original machine had two CPUs, and it was described quite adequately in a 1961 paper by Bob Barton, who was the main designer. One of the great documents was called “The Descriptor” and laid it out in detail. The problem was that almost everything in this machine was quite different and what it was trying to achieve was quite different.</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 事实上，原始的机器有两个CPU，这已经在主要设计者Bob Barton于1961年写的一篇文章中非常充分地讨论了。其中一篇伟大的文献被称为“描述子”(Descriptor)，并详细设计了它。问题是这个机器几乎所有的东西都是不同的，而且它试图达到的目标也完全不同。</p>

<p>The reason that line lived on—even though the establishment didn’t like it—was precisely because it was almost impossible to crash it, and so the banking industry kept on buying this line of machines, starting with the B5000. Barton was one of my professors in college, and I had adapted some of the ideas on the first desktop machine that I did. Then we did a much better job of adapting the ideas at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center).</p>

<p>那条线存活的原因，即使保守派不喜欢它，恰恰是它几乎不可能崩溃，所以从B5000开始，银行业不断地购买这条线的机器。Barton是我大学时的教授之一，我在做第一个桌面机器时采用其中一些想法。然后我们在施乐PARC采纳这些想法做出了更加出色的工作。</p>

<p>Neither Intel nor Motorola nor any other chip company understands the first thing about why that architecture was a good idea.</p>

<p>无论是英特尔还是摩托罗那，或其它任何芯片公司，都不理解这个首要的事情，为什么那个架构是个好点子。</p>

<p>Just as an aside, to give you an interesting benchmark—on roughly the same system, roughly optimized the same way, a benchmark from 1979 at Xerox PARC runs only 50 times faster today. Moore’s law has given us somewhere between 40,000 and 60,000 times improvement in that time. So there’s approximately a factor of 1,000 in efficiency that has been lost by bad CPU architectures.</p>

<p>仅仅插一句，给你一个有趣的指标 - 对大致相同的机器，大致用相同的方式优化，根据施乐Xerox在1979的基准，今天的机器只快了50倍。在这个期间，摩尔定律给了我们大概40000到60000倍的提升。因此，由于糟糕的CPU架构设计，大约有因子为1000倍的效率损失。</p>

<p>The myth that it doesn’t matter what your processor architecture is—that Moore’s law will take care of you—is totally false.</p>

<p>不用在意处理器的架构，摩尔定律将照顾你。这个神话，是完全错误的。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> It also has something to do with why some languages succeed at certain times.</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 也看看为什么一些语言在特定时间会成功。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> Yes, actually both Lisp and Smalltalk were done in by the eight-bit microprocessor—it’s not because they’re eight-bit micros, it’s because the processor architectures were bad, and they just killed the dynamic languages. Today these languages run reasonably because even though the architectures are still bad, the level 2 caches are so large that some fraction of the things that need to work, work reasonably well inside the caches; so both Lisp and Smalltalk can do their things and are viable today. But both of them are quite obsolete, of course.</p>

<p>是的，事实上Lisp和Smalltalk都在8位微处理器上完成 - 这不是因为他们是8位的微指令，而是因为糟糕的处理器架构，它们刚好扼杀了动态语言。今天，这些语言合情合理地运行着，因为即使架构仍然糟糕，但是L2缓冲如此大，有些需要做的事情，在缓冲中能合情合理地良好运行；因此Lisp和Smalltalk可以做他们的事情，它们在今天是可行的语言。但是，当然，它们两个快要过时了。</p>

<p>The stuff that is in vogue today is only about “one-half” of those languages. Sun Microsystems had the right people to make Java into a first-class language, and I believe it was the Sun marketing people who rushed the thing out before it should have gotten out. They made it impossible for the Sun software people to do what needed to be done.</p>

<p>今天在流行的东西，只是那些语言的“一半”。Sun公司有正确的人将Java变成第一流的语言。我相信这是Sun的营销人员在其本该出现之前，赶制出来的。他们使得Sun的软件人员不可能去做需要做的事。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> What should Java have had in it to be a first-quality language, not just a commercial success?</p>

<p>为了成为第一流的语言，而非商业的成功，Java本身还需具备什么？</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> Like I said, it’s a pop culture. A commercial hit record for teenagers doesn’t have to have any particular musical merits. I think a lot of the success of various programming languages is expeditious gap-filling. Perl is another example of filling a tiny, short-term need, and then being a real problem in the longer term. Basically, a lot of the problems that computing has had in the last 25 years comes from systems where the designers were trying to fix some short-term thing and didn’t think about whether the idea would scale if it were adopted. There should be a half-life on software so old software just melts away over 10 or 15 years.</p>

<p>如同我前面说的，这是个流行文化。给十多岁青少年听的流行唱片，不必要有特别的音乐价值。我认为各种编程语言的很大成功是应急式的填坑。Perl是另外一个例子，为了满足细微而短期的需求，却成为更长期内的一个实际麻烦。根本上讲，过去25年中计算方面的很多问题，都来自于这样的系统，设计者试图修复一些事情，并没有思考如果采纳的话，这个点子应具扩展性。软件本该只有一半的寿命<em>(注：过去25年产生的软件)</em>，因此旧软件刚好在10到15年间消逝掉。</p>

<p>It was a different culture in the ’60s and ’70s; the ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) and PARC culture was basically a mathematical/scientific kind of culture and was interested in scaling, and of course, the Internet was an exercise in scaling. There are just two different worlds, and I don’t think it’s even that helpful for people from one world to complain about the other world — like people from a literary culture complaining about the majority of the world that doesn’t read for ideas. It’s futile.</p>

<p>在1960和70年代，有着不同的文化；高级研究项目管理局(ARPA)和帕洛阿尔托研究中心(PARC)的文化，根本上讲，是一种数学/科学性的文化，对扩展性感兴趣。当然，Inernet就是规模化的一个练习。恰恰有两个不同的世界。我不认为，一个世界的人抱怨另一个世界的人甚至有什么帮助，就好像来自一个文学文化的人们抱怨世界上大多数的人不能读懂意思。这是无用的。</p>

<p>I don’t spend time complaining about this stuff, because what happened in the last 20 years is quite normal, even though it was unfortunate. Once you have something that grows faster than education grows, you’re always going to get a pop culture. It’s well known that I tried to kill Smalltalk in the later ’70s. There were a few years when it was the most wonderful thing in the world. It answered needs in a more compact and beautiful way than anything that had been done before. But time moves on. As we learned more and got more ambitious about what we wanted to do, we realized that there are all kinds of things in Smalltalk that don’t scale the way they should—for instance, the reflection stuff that we had in there. It was one of the first languages to really be able to see itself, but now it is known how to do all levels of reflection much better—so we should implement that.</p>

<p>我不想花时间抱怨这个事，因为在过去20年发生的非常正常，即使这是不幸的。一旦你有些东西，它比教育增长得更快，你总会得到一个流行文化。众所周知，我试图在70年代晚期终结Smalltalk。它在一些年头是世界上最漂亮的东西。它用比之前做过的任何东西更为紧致和漂亮的方式去回应需要，但时间在往前走。随着我们学会更多，对我们想做的事更有抱负的时候，我们认识到在Smalltalk中所有种类的事物，不能以它们本该的方式去扩展–例如，发射。它是真正看到它自身的最早的语言之一，但是现在知道了如何更好地做所有层次的反射。因此，我们必须实现之。</p>

<p>We saw after a couple of years that this could be done much better. The object model we saw after a couple of years could be done much better, etc. So the problem is—I’ve said this about both Smalltalk and Lisp—they tend to eat their young. What I mean is that both Lisp and Smalltalk are really fabulous vehicles, because they have a meta-system. They have so many ways of dealing with problems that the early-binding languages don’t have, that it’s very, very difficult for people who like Lisp or Smalltalk to imagine anything else.</p>

<p>几年之后我们看到，这可以做得更好。我们几年之后看到的对象模型可以做得更好，等等。因此，问题是–我曾经说过关于Smalltalk和Lisp，它们常常吃掉它们的幼崽。我的意思是，Lisp和Smalltalk是真正绝妙的载具，因为它们有一个元系统。它们有那些早期绑定语言不具备的如此多的方式去处理问题，以至于对于喜欢Lisp或Smalltalk的人非常难以想象还有其它什么。</p>

<p>Now just to mention a couple of things about Java: it really doesn’t have a full meta-system. It has always had the problem—for a variety of reasons—of having two regimes, not one regime. It has things that aren’t objects, and it has things that it calls objects. It has real difficulty in being dynamic. It has a garbage collector. So what? Those have been around for a long time. But it’s not that great at adding to itself.</p>

<p>现在谈到Java的一些事情：它确实没有一个全面的元系统。它总是因为不同的原因，有一个问题：它存在两个体制，而非一个体制。它有一些不是对象的东西，它有一些称为对象的东西。它成为动态的有实际的困难。它有一个垃圾收集器。那又怎么样？这些已经四处都是很久了。只将垃圾收集器加到它里面，不算高明。</p>

<p>For many years, the development kits for Java were done in C++. That is a telling thing.</p>

<p>在很多年，Java的开发工具用C++完成。这是个有说服力的事情。</p>

<p>We looked at Java very closely in 1995 when we were starting on a major set of implementations, just because it’s a lot of work to do a viable language kernel. The thing we liked least about Java was the way it was implemented. It had this old idea, which has never worked, of having a set of paper specs, having to implement the VM (virtual machine) to the paper specs, and then having benchmarks that try to validate what you’ve just implemented — and that has never resulted in a completely compatible system.</p>

<p>我们在1995年仔细观察Java，当时我们正着手一个主要的实现集，仅仅因为做一个可行的核有很多事情要干。我们最不喜欢的事情，是Java实现的方式。它有这样的陈旧想法，从来没有奏效过，即：定义一组纸面上的规范，要求按照纸面规范去实现VM(虚拟机)，然后用标杆去试图验证你刚刚实现的。这个想法从来没有产生一个完全兼容的系统。</p>

<p>The technique that we had for Smalltalk was to write the VM in itself, so there’s a Smalltalk simulator of the VM that was essentially the only specification of the VM. You could debug and you could answer any question about what the VM would do by submitting stuff to it, and you made every change that you were going to make to the VM by changing the simulator. After you had gotten everything debugged the way you wanted, you pushed the button and it would generate, without human hands touching it, a mathematically correct version of C that would go on whatever platform you were trying to get onto.</p>

<p>我们用在Smalltalk上的技术是用它自己来写虚拟机，因此有一个VM的Smalltalk仿真器，它本质上就是VM的唯一规范。通过将材料提交给它，你可以调试，你可以回答任何问题，关于VM可以做什么。一旦你将所有事情都以你想的方式调试通过，你按一下按钮，不需要人去插手，它将生成一个数学上正确的C版本，可以在你想尝试的任何平台上去运行。</p>

<p>The result is that this system today, called Squeak, runs identically on more than two dozen platforms. Java does not do that. If you think about what the Internet means, it means you have to run identically on everything that is hooked to the Internet. So Java, to me, has always violated one of the prime things about software engineering in the world of the Internet.</p>

<p>这一成果就是，今天称为Squeak的这个系统，在超过20个平台上无差别地运行。Java做不到这点。如果你想想Internet意味着什么，它意味着你必须无差别地运行任何挂在Internet上的东西。因此，Java，对我来说，常常违反关于软件工程在Internet世界的一个初衷。</p>

<p>Once we realized that Java was likely not to be compatible from platform to platform, we basically said we’ll generate our own system that is absolutely compatible from platform to platform, and that’s what we did.</p>

<p>一旦我们认识到，Java可能从平台到平台不兼容，我们从根本上决定，我们将生成我们自己的系统，它在平台到平台之间是绝对兼容的。这就是我们做的。</p>

<p>Anybody can do that. If the pros at Sun had had a chance to fix Java, the world would be a much more pleasant place. This is not secret knowledge. It’s just secret to this pop culture.</p>

<p>任何人都能做到。假使Sun的正方有机会修正Java，世界将会是更为愉悦的地方。这里没有机密的知识。仅仅对这一流行文化是个秘密。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> If nothing else, Lisp was carefully defined in terms of Lisp.</p>

<p>如果没有其它的，Lisp是仔细以Lisp的方式定义的。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> Yes, that was the big revelation to me when I was in graduate school—when I finally understood that the half page of code on the bottom of page 13 of the Lisp 1.5 manual was Lisp in itself. These were “Maxwell’s Equations of Software!” This is the whole world of programming in a few lines that I can put my hand over.</p>

<p>是的，当我在研究生院时，这对我是个巨大的启示–当我最终理解Lisp 1.5版手册第13页下部的半页代码，是Lisp自己的时候。这就是“软件中的麦克斯韦方程”。整个的编程世界可以放在聊聊几代码中–可以写在我的掌心。</p>

<p>I realized that anytime I want to know what I’m doing, I can just write down the kernel of this thing in a half page and it’s not going to lose any power. In fact, it’s going to gain power by being able to reenter itself much more readily than most systems done the other way can possibly do.</p>

<p>我认识到，任何时候当我想知道我正在做的，我就将这件事的核心写在半页纸上，这没有丧失任何力量。事实上，通过能够更容易地重新进入事情，比大多数系统尽可能用其它方式所能做的，将会获得力量。</p>

<p>All of these ideas could be part of both software engineering and computer science, but I fear—as far as I can tell—that most undergraduate degrees in computer science these days are basically Java vocational training.</p>

<p>所有这些想法，可以是软件工程和计算机科学的一部分。但是我担心–就我的判断–计算机科学里的大多数本科学位，根本上讲，是Java的职业培训。</p>

<p>I’ve heard complaints from even mighty Stanford University with its illustrious faculty that basically the undergraduate computer science program is little more than Java certification.</p>

<p>我从甚至强大的、拥有杰出教师队伍的斯坦福大学那里听到的抱怨是，根本上讲，本科计算机科学课程，没有比Java认证多出什么。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> Well, I must admit I was surprised recently when I discovered in a group of very good developers I managed, almost none of them knew C well enough to write expert low-level stuff. All of them were really good Java jocks.</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 好的，我必须承认，最近我有些惊讶，当我发现我管理的一个优秀开发人员组成的团队，几乎没有人足够懂C，能写出专家级的底层工作。他们确实都是Java的好手。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> In the 1960s Ted Steele spent several years promoting an idea called UNCOL (universal computer-oriented language), and, to me, by a weird and interesting process—mainly because it’s easy to implement—C turned out to be UNCOL. I don’t think any human being should write in it, but it’s a great target for anybody who wants to do multiplatform things—especially if you pick the right subset.</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 在1960年代，Ted Steele花了好几年向我推广一个称为UNCOL(universal computer-oriented language，通用面向计算机语言)的想法，通过一个怪诞和有趣的过程，主要是因为它容易实施 - C原来是UNCOL。我不认为任何人必须用它写程序，但是对于任何想做多平台事情的人，它是一个伟大的目标，特别是如果你选择了正确的子集。</p>

<p>The problem with the Cs, as you probably know if you’ve fooled around in detail with them, is that they’re not quite kosher as far as their arithmetic is concerned. They are supposed to be, but they’re not quite up to the IEEE standards. You have to pick a subset of C and you have to have some side information to get to a mathematically perfect transform of your VM.</p>

<p>各种C的问题，正如你可能知道的，如果你已经在细节上虚度时，只要算法被关注，他们就不那么合适。他们假定是，但他们没有完全遵守IEEE标准。你不得不选取C的子集，你必须有一些侧面的信息来得到对你虚拟机(VM)在数学上的完美转化。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> To what do you attribute the long-term love of Smalltalk? There is a certain set of languages that I would assert people seem to love, not just use. I know many people who love C. I know very few who love C++, even though they may make their living on it.</p>

<p>你把对Smalltalk长期的热爱归因于什么？有确定的一组语言，我断言人们看起来热爱，而不仅仅是使用。我知道，很多人爱C。我知道很少有人爱C++，尽管他们靠其谋生。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> You have to be a different kind of person to love C++. It is a really interesting example of how a well-meant idea went wrong, because [C++ creator] Bjarne Stroustrup was not trying to do what he has been criticized for. His idea was that first, it might be useful if you did to C what Simula did to Algol, which is basically act as a preprocessor for a different kind of architectural template for programming. It was basically for super-good programmers who are supposed to subclass everything, including the storage allocator, before they did anything serious. The result, of course, was that most programmers did not subclass much. So the people I know who like C++ and have done good things in C++ have been serious iron-men who have basically taken it for what it is, which is a kind of macroprocessor. I grew up with macro systems in the early ’60s, and you have to do a lot of work to make them work for you—otherwise, they kill you.</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 为了爱C++，你必须成为不同的人。这的确是个有趣的例子，良好用意的想法被搞砸了，因为C++的创造者Bjarne Stroustrup没有试图做那些他被批评的事。他的想法是，首先，如果对C做那些Simula对Algol做的事<em>(注：预处理器</em>，那是可能有用的。其根本上是作为一个预处理器，针对一个不同类的编程架构模板。对于超级程序员，在他们做任何正儿八经的事之前，假定可以子类化任何事物，是最基本的，包括对存储分配器。因此，我所知道的那些喜欢C++，并用它做出漂亮工作的人，是严肃的钢铁侠。他们只使用C++原本做的事，作为一种预处理器。在60年代早期，伴随宏系统而成长，你必须做很多事情来让它们为你工作–否则，它们会杀了你。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> Well, C++, after all, was programmed as a macro processor, in essence.</p>

<p>好的，C++，毕竟，本质上，作为一个宏处理器来编写的。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> Yes, exactly. But so was Simula.</p>

<p>是的，确实是。但Simula也是这样。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> I put Smalltalk in this category of languages that have true devotees—people who genuinely like it or love it, not simply appreciate and use it.</p>

<p>我把Smalltalk放在有真正热爱者的一类语言，人们真正地喜欢或爱它，而非仅仅欣赏或使用它。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> In a history of Smalltalk I wrote for ACM, I characterized one way of looking at languages in this way: a lot of them are either the agglutination of features or they’re a crystallization of style. Languages such as APL, Lisp, and Smalltalk are what you might call style languages, where there’s a real center and imputed style to how you’re supposed to do everything. Other languages such as PL/I and, indeed, languages that try to be additive without consolidation have often been more successful. I think the style languages appeal to people who have a certain mathematical laziness to them. Laziness actually pays off later on, because if you wind up spending a little extra time seeing that “oh, yes, this language is going to allow me to do this really, really nicely, and in a more general way than I could do it over here,” usually that comes back to help you when you’ve had a new idea a year down the road. The agglutinative languages, on the other hand, tend to produce agglutinations and they are very, very difficult to untangle when you’ve had that new idea.</p>

<p>在我为ACM写的一个Smalltalk的历史中，我描述一种看待语言的方式：很多语言要么是特性的凝聚，要么是风格的具体化(结晶)。象APL，Lisp和Smalltalk是你所称的风格性语言，它有真正的中心，然后把风格灌输到你假设要做的任何事情上。其它的语言，比如PL/I，那些试图加和特性而不做整合的语言，的确经常更成功。我认为，风格性语言吸引那些有特定数学惰性的人。懒惰实际上在日后有回报的，因为如果你停下来花一点点额外的时间看看“哦，对的，这个语言将允许我的的确确漂亮地做这个事，并以更普遍的方式让我在这儿来做”。而且如果你已经有了一年之后的新想法，这通常会回来帮到你。凝聚性语言，相反，常常产生凝聚性，当你有新想法时，它们非常非常难以解开。</p>

<p>Also, I think the style languages tend to be late-binding languages. The agglutinative languages are usually early-binding. That makes a huge difference in the whole approach. The kinds of bugs you have to deal with, and when you have to deal with them, is completely different.</p>

<p>而且，我认为风格性语言常常是延迟绑定的语言。凝聚性语言通常是早期绑定的。这在整个实现途径上，产生了极大的不同。你必须面对的bug类型，你必须在何时处理它们，都完全不同。</p>

<p>Some people are completely religious about type systems and as a mathematician I love the idea of type systems, but nobody has ever come up with one that has enough scope. If you combine Simula and Lisp—Lisp didn’t have data structures, it had instances of objects—you would have a dynamic type system that would give you the range of expression you need.</p>

<p>一些人对类型系统有完全宗教式的虔诚。作为数学家，我喜爱类型系统的想法，但是没有人曾经拿出过有足够范围的类型系统。如果你将Simula和Lisp综合起来，Lisp没有数据结构，它有对象实例–你将有一个动态类型系统，这会给你你所需的表达式的范围。</p>

<p>It would allow you to think the kinds of thoughts you need to think without worrying about what type something is, because you have a much, much wider range of things. What you’re paying for is some of the checks that can be done at runtime, and, especially in the old days, you paid for it in some efficiencies. Now we get around the efficiency stuff the same way Barton did on the B5000: by just saying, “Screw it, we’re going to execute this important stuff as directly as we possibly can.” We’re not going to worry about whether we can compile it into a von Neumann computer or not, and we will make the microcode do whatever we need to get around these inefficiencies because a lot of the inefficiencies are just putting stuff on obsolete hardware architectures.</p>

<p>这会允许你思考，那些你需要思考的想法，而不需担心类型是什么，因为你有一个非常非常更为宽泛的事物。你要付出的代价是，要做些检查，这可在运行时完成，特别是在旧的时期，你能用有效的方式支付这些代价。现在，我们绕开了Barton在B5000上以相同方式做的有效性东西，仅仅通过说，“上紧螺丝，我们将尽可能直接地执行这个重要的事情”。我们将没去担心我们是否能将其编译到一个冯诺依曼计算机里，以及我们将让微代码执行任何我们需要去绕过这些无效的地方，因为很多无效性仅仅是将事情放在过时的硬件架构上。</p>

<p>I just think that’s a two-culture divide. I’ve seen many meetings where people are unable to communicate just because of the stylistic differences in approaches.</p>

<p>我只是想这是两种文化的分割。我已经看过很多会议中，人们不能沟通，仅仅因为处理风格的不同。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> I would characterize style languages as those with a very rigorous kernel that describes them intellectually. As Smalltalk went through a number of revolutions, to what extent did those change the core kernel, as opposed to improving the range of usefulness?</p>

<p>我认为风格性语言的特征是，具有非常严谨的内核，它智能地描述了语言。Smalltalk经历过一些革新，相对于改进实用性的范围，它们在多大程度是对中心核的改变？</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> We’ll never know the exact answer to your question because during the development of the system, from when Xerox put it out to this day, all the changes happened in a single thread of development at Xerox PARC. To the outside world, Smalltalk has changed almost not at all. Basically, it’s just built on bigger and bigger libraries of different kinds.</p>

<p>对你的问题，很难有确切的答案，因为在开发系统的过程中，从施乐将它创造出来到今天，所有的改变发生在施乐PARC开发的单一线程上。对于外在的世界，Smalltalk几乎没有一点改变。根本上讲，它仅仅是构建在越来越庞大的不同种类的库上。</p>

<p>But the good thing about the changes in Smalltalk was that it never got diluted, and the scope of the practical things you could think about doing in Smalltalk expanded dramatically during the period at Xerox PARC.</p>

<p>但是，关于Smalltalk的改变，好事是它从来没有被稀释过。你能想到用Smalltalk的实际工作的范围，在施乐PARC的期间，急剧地扩展了。</p>

<p>Basically what happened is this vehicle became more and more a programmer’s vehicle and less and less a children’s vehicle—the version that got put out, Smalltalk ’80, I don’t think it was ever programmed by a child. I don’t think it could have been programmed by a child because it had lost some of its amenities, even as it gained pragmatic power.</p>

<p>根本上讲，所发生的是，这个载具越来越变成一个程序员的载具，越来越少地作为儿童的工具–它得以出生的版本， Smalltalk ‘80，我不认为它曾由儿童来编程。我不认为他本应该已由小孩来编程，因为它已经失去了一些便利性，即使它获得了实用的力量。</p>

<p>So the death of Smalltalk in a way came as soon as it got recognized by real programmers as being something useful; they made it into more of their own image, and it started losing its nice end-user features.</p>

<p>因此，Smalltalk的死亡会以这种方式来临，一旦它被实际的程序员认为是有些用；他们按自己的想象去改变它，结果它开始失去了它漂亮的最终用户接口。</p>

<p>But that’s OK. This project that we started in 1995 was to make Squeak as an implementation vehicle for another end-user system for children. That was done quite well and is being used by many, many thousands of children around the world. The other way of looking at this is to realize that <strong><em>computers are made to be programmed by human beings</em></strong>. Let’s just roll our own. Let’s not complain about Java, or even about Smalltalk.</p>

<p>但这挺好的。我们开始于1995年的项目是把Squeak作为一个实现载具，它针对另一个面向孩子的最终用户系统。这件事做得很棒，已经被很多很多世界各地成千上万的孩子使用。看待这事的另一个方式是，认识到<strong><em>计算机做出来，就是为了让人类编程的</em></strong>。就让我们孤军奋战吧。让我们不要抱怨Java，乃至Smalltalk。</p>

<p>In fact, let’s not even worry about Java. Let’s not complain about Microsoft. Let’s not worry about them because we know how to program computers, too, and in fact we know how to do it in a meta-way. We can set up an alternative point of view, and we’re not the only ones who do this, as you’re well aware.</p>

<p>事实上，让我们甚至不要抱怨Java。让我们不要抱怨微软。让我们不要抱怨他们，因为我们知道如何对计算机编程，事实上我们知道如何对之采用元的方式(in a meta-way)。我们可以建立一个替代的视角，我们不是唯一这样做的人，你对此也很清楚。</p>

<p>There are numerous examples on the Internet of people who have gone to one level or another by making their own point of view. Squeak is the most comprehensive because it spans the whole field. It doesn’t require any particular operating system to run because it’s self-sufficient and has a full set of tools and applications and so forth, but there are many interesting functional languages, particularly in Europe, that are of interest.</p>

<p>在互联网上有大量的例子，通过有他们自己的观点，他们达到这个或那个层次。Squeak是最丰富的，因为它扩展到整个领域。它不需要特定的操作系统去运行，因为它是自给自足的，并有完整的工具集和应用等。不过，在欧洲，有很多有趣的函数式语言，很有趣。</p>

<p>One of my favorite old languages is one called Lucid by Ed Ashcroft. It was a beautiful idea. He said, “Hey, look, we can regard a variable as a stream, as some sort of ordered thing of its values and time, and use Christopher Strachey’s idea that everything is wonderful about tail recursion and Lisp, except what it looks like.” When he looked at Lisp, he had a great insight: which was that tail-recursive loops and Lisp are so clean because you’re generating the right-hand side of all the assignment statements before you do any rebinding. So you’re automatically forced to use only old values. You cannot rebind, so there are no race conditions on anything.</p>

<p>我喜欢的一个老的语言，Ed Ashcroft称之为Lucid。这是一个很漂亮的点子。他说，“嘿，看，我们能把变量看做一个流，以它的值和时间为排序，然后用Christopher Strachey的想法，即每件事情都是关于尾部递归和Lisp，除过它看起来的样子”。当他看到Lisp，他有了伟大的洞见：那就是，尾部递归循环和Lisp是如此清晰，因此你在做任何重新绑定之前，你正在生成所有赋值语句的右侧。因此，<strong><em>你自动地被强制只使用旧的值。你不能重新绑定，因此这里没有对任何东西的竞争。</em></strong></p>

<p>You just write down all of those things, and then when you do the tail recursion, you rebind all of those variables with these new values. Strachey said, “I can write that down like a sequential program, as a bunch of simultaneous assignment statements, and a loop that makes it easier to think of.” That’s basically what Lucid did—there is no reason that you have to think recursively for things that are basically iteration, and you can make these iterations as clean as a functional language if you have a better theory about what values are.</p>

<p>你恰恰正在写下所有那些事情，然后当你做尾部递归时，你用这些新值重新绑定所有的那些变量。Strachey说“我能象一个顺序程序一样写下他们，就像一捆同时赋值的语句，以及一个让它容易思考的循环“。这根本上讲，就是Lucid做的，<strong>没有理由你必须用递归方式思考那些本质上是迭代的事物</strong>。如果你有一个更好地关于值是什么的理论，你就能让这些迭代象函数式语言一样干净。</p>

<p>This idea, by the way, was used in [Squeak contributor] Dave Reed’s fantastic thesis for coordinating object siblings where you have one logical object but many physical manifestations of the same object on different machines, and you have to make them track each other by transactions.</p>

<p>顺便说一下，这个想法，在Dave Reed为了协调对象兄弟的美妙命题中也用到，在那里你有一个逻辑的对象，但是在不同机器上有很多相同对象的物理显化，你必须用事务来让他们可跟踪彼此。</p>

<p>The way to get rid of these things (like Smalltalk) is to make something that is much, much more powerful as a computation model and much more expressive for the core programmer who is trying to write programs. In these late programming languages, you can disappear the old guy and just leave the new guy behind. So we are doing that at this moment.</p>

<p>去掉这些事情的方式是做出一些更加更加强大的东西，来作为一个计算模型，并为了那些尝试写程序的核心程序员，要更具表现力。在这些后期的编程语言，你能让旧的家伙消失，而只让新的家伙在幕后。因此，我们现在就在做这些。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> What do you think a programming language should achieve and for whom, and then what is the model that goes with that idea?</p>

<p>你认为一个编程语言必须达到什么，并为谁？然后什么是与这个想法相配的模型？</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> Even if you’re designing for professional programmers, in the end your programming language is basically a user-interface design. You will get much better results regardless of what you’re trying to do if you think of it as a user-interface design. PARC is incorrectly credited with having invented the GUI. Of course, there were GUIs in the ’60s. But I think we did do one good thing that hadn’t been done before, and that was to realize the idea of change being eternal.</p>

<p>即使你正在为专业的程序员设计语言，最终，你的编程语言根本上讲是用户界面设计。如果你将它看做一个用户界面设计，无论你正在尝试做什么，你都会得到更好一些的结果。GUI的发明被错误地归功于PARC。当然，在60年代有很多GUI。但是，我想我们的确做了之前从未做的一件好事，</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> You never walk in the same river, otherwise known as Strachey streams.</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 你不会踏入同一条河流，就如同Strachey流。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> The user interface, which is still the predominant approach today, is a user interface as the access to function. If the area is interesting, you eventually wind up with something that looks like the control panel of a nuclear reactor. So this is the agglutination of features.</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 用户界面，在今天仍然是主导性的途径，是访问功能的用户界面。如果这个领域有趣，你最终会完成某些东西，看起来像核反应堆的控制面板。因此，这是特性的凝聚。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> Yes, a button on every pixel.</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 是的，每个像素有个按钮。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> Corporate buyers often buy in terms of feature sets. But at PARC our idea was, since you never step in the same river twice, the number-one thing you want to make the user interface be is a learning environment—something that’s explorable in various ways, something that is going to change over the lifetime of the user using this environment. New things are going to come on, and what does it mean for those new things to happen?</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 公司采购者经常按照特性集去采购。但是在PARC，我们的想法是，<strong><em>既然你不可能再次踏入同一条河流，你对用户界面想做的第一件事，是让它成为一个学习的环境</em></strong>–可以用不同方式去探索的东西，能够在用户使用这个环境的生命周期中不断改变。新事物总会到来，对于这些会发生的新事物，它(用户界面)意味着什么。</p>

<p>This means improvements not only in the applications but also in the user interface itself. Some of those ideas were quite manifest in the original Macintosh, but are much less manifest in the Macs of today—and of course never really made it to Microsoft. That just wasn’t their way of thinking about things, and I think a programming language is the same way. Even if the user is an absolute expert, able to remember almost everything, I’m always interested in the difference between what you might call stark meaning and adjustable meaning.</p>

<p>这意味着改进不但在应用层面，也在用户界面自身。在早期的Macintosh中，如此的一些想法十分明显，但是在今天的Mac电脑中却非常少见了 - 当然对微软事实上从未有过。这不仅指他们思考事情的方式，我想编程语言也一样。即使用户是绝对的专家，能记住几乎所有事情，我也对简易含义与可调整含义之间的差别，总保持兴趣。</p>

<p>I did quite a bit of study on that over the years to understand the influence of having something that you can read. It’s known that our basic language mechanism for both reading and hearing has a fast and a slow process. The fast process has basically a surface phrasal-size nature, and then there’s a slower one. This is why jokes require pauses; the joke is actually a jump from one context to another, and the slower guy, who is dealing with the real meanings, has to catch up to it.</p>

<p>在过去的一些年头，我做了些研究去理解，你有可阅读之物的影响。众所周知，我们的基础语言机制，对于读或听，有一个快速和一个慢速过程。快速过程根本上讲，具有表面的、短语尺度的特性。然后有一个更慢的过程。这就是为什么笑话需要停顿；笑话事实上是从一个语境跳到另一个语境。反应慢的人，他是在理解实际的意思，不得不跟上这个跳跃。</p>

<p>There have been many, many studies of this. This argues that the surface form of a language, whatever it is, has to be adjustable in some form.</p>

<p>有很多很多这样的研究。这表明，语言的表面形式，无论它是什么，必须以某种形式可调整。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> As you probably know, recent research has looked at how different parts of the brain recognize and react to jokes. Physically, they are quite distinct.</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 你大概知道，近期的研究已经在关注，大脑的不同部位，如何认出笑话并对之反映。物理上看，它们非常独特。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> Yes. All creativity is an extended form of a joke. Most creativity is a transition from one context into another where things are more surprising. There’s an element of surprise, and especially in science, there is often laughter that goes along with the “Aha.” Art also has this element. Our job is to remind us that there are more contexts than the one that we’re in—the one that we think is reality.</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 是的。所有创造性是笑话的一种延伸形式。绝大多数的创造性是从一个环境到另一个的跃迁，在后者中事情更为出乎意料。有个惊讶的要素，特别是科学中，经常是大笑之后跟着一个”啊哈”。艺术也有这个要素。我们的工作是让我们忆起，在我们所处的–我们认为是现实的环境之外，还有更多的环境。</p>

<p>In the ’60s, one of the primary goals of the computer science community was to arrive at an extensible language. As far as I know, only three ever actually worked, and the first Smalltalk was one of those three. Another very interesting one was done by Ned Irons, who invented the term syntax-directed compiler and did one of the first ones in the ’60s. He did a wonderful extensible language called Imp.</p>

<p>在60年代，计算机科学社群的一个主要目标是发明一个可延展的语言。就我所知，只有三个实际上做到了，第一代的Smalltalk是三者之一。另一个有趣的语言是由Ned Irons做出，他发明了“术语语法导向”的编译器，然后在60年代做出了首批的其中之一。他做出了一个漂亮的可延展语言，称之为Imp。</p>

<p>One of the things that people realized from these extensible languages is that there is the unfortunate difficulty of making the meta-system easy to use. Smalltalk-72 was actually used by children. You’re always extending the language without realizing it when you are making ordinary classes. The result of this was that you didn’t have to go into a more esoteric place like a compiler compiler—Yacc or something like that—to add some extension to the language.</p>

<p>人们从这些可延展的语言中认识到，做出易于使用的元系统，很不幸，是困难的。Smalltalk-72的确由孩子使用。当你在做普通类时(ordinary classes)，你总是在扩展语言而没认识到。结果是，你不必进入到一个更为神秘的地方，比如编译器的编译器–Yacc或其它类似的–为了给语言添加扩展。</p>

<p>But the flip side of the coin was that even good programmers and language designers tended to do terrible extensions when they were in the heat of programming, because design is something that is best done slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>但是硬币的另一面是，甚至优秀的程序员和语言设计者，也常常做出可怕的扩展，因为最好慢慢地、仔细地做设计。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> And late-night extensible programming is unsupportable.</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 不支持宵夜式的可延展语言。</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> Exactly. So Smalltalk actually went from something that was completely extensible to one where we picked a syntax that allowed for a variety of forms of what was fixed, and concentrated on the extensibility of meaning in it.</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> 的确。因此，Smalltalk事实上来自那些可完全延展到的东西，而达到一个语言，在其中我们选择一个语法，允许各种固定下来的形式，然后我们专心于其中含义的可延展性。</p>

<p>This is not completely satisfactory. One of the things that I think should be done today is to have a fence that you have to hop to forcibly remind you that you’re now in a meta-area—that you are now tinkering with the currency system itself, you are not just speculating. But it should allow you to do it without any other overhead once you’ve crossed this fence, because when you want to do it, you want to do it.</p>

<p>这还没有完全满意。我考虑今天必须做的事情之一是，设置一个围栏，强制你必须跳过去，从而提醒你，你现在处于一个元领域–你现在正在摆弄货币系统本身，你不仅仅是在投机。但是，一旦你跨过了这道围栏，它将允许你这么做，没有任何其它的开销。因为，当你想做的时候，你就是想做它。</p>

<p>I could go on and on. I feel like my answers are quite trivial since nobody really knows how to design a good language, including me.</p>

<p>我会继续往前、往前走。我感觉，我的回答是非常微不足道的，既然没有人真的知道如何设计一个好的语言，包括我。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> What do you wish you had done differently in the Smalltalk era?</p>

<p>你希望，在Smalltalk时代，你有什么会做的不同？</p>

<p><strong>AK</strong> I had the world’s greatest group, and I should have made the world’s two greatest groups. I didn’t realize there are benefits to having real implementers and real users, and there are benefits to starting from scratch every few months. I hired finishers because I’m a good starter and a poor finisher, but it took me a long time to realize that I was interfering with them by trying to improve things.</p>

<p>我有世界上最伟大的团队，我本应该建立两个最伟大的团队。我没有认识到，同时拥有真实的实现者和真实的用户，其中的好处，以及每几个月从头开始的好处。我聘用了润饰者(完工者)，因为我是个好的启动者却是个糟糕的润饰者。但是，我花了很长时间才认识到，我为了试图改进事情，正在打扰他们。</p>

<p>I believe that the only kind of science computing can be is like the science of bridge building. Somebody has to build the bridges and other people have to tear them down and make better theories, and you have to keep on building bridges.</p>

<p>我相信，计算科学唯一的类别好似桥梁构建的科学。有些人必须造桥，而其他的人必须拆卸它们并作出更好的理论，而你不得不继续造桥。</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> And every so often, you have to watch one fall into the drink.</p>

<p><strong>SF</strong> 时不时，你不得不看到有人沉迷于酒中。</p>
